# Discord Classroom
### Inspiration
During the pandemic, it was really difficult to communicate with our teachers and there weren't nearly as many opportunities to catch up or learn more. We want to change that using Discord, an easy to use messaging platform and its API. We didn't like how emails can be slow and you can only really send it to your teacher, and if you want more help, you'll have to text or email your classmates individually.

### What it does
It will turn an entire server into a classroom where students can chat and ask questions. It also has a simple dashboard where teachers can view information about their server, and interact with our data about their classroom.

### How we built it
We mostly used javascript, and many of its libraries and frameworks.

### Challenges we ran into
We had a lot of difficulty with the dashboard, and interacting with Discord through the database and the website, since none of us had ever really worked in that area before.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're really proud that we got the Discord Bot done quickly, and were able to get Discord authentication done through the browser.

### What we learned
We learned a lot about Axios and servers, and how we can communicate through different programs with simple libraries.

### What's next for Discord Classroom
We wanted there to be more options for the teacher, like sending announcements/resources/schedules through the bot, and getting them to be stored in the database for later use.
